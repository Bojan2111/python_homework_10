# Python Homework No. 10
## Python homework from Pirple Course - import and use a python library

This task is about importing one library and put it to practice.
I have decided to go with the Statistics library and showcase the
possibilities with managing statistical data analysis.

In statistics, mean, mode, standard deviation and variance are
most commonly used methods to describe the importance or certain
aspects of data.

Lucky for us, Python offers a built in library for this. For more
advanced data analysis, especially with big data, consider using
pandas open source library.

Potential use is with analyzing user input.

All suggestions welcome! Thanks!
